## Video Visual Relation Detection Helpler

This repository contains some helper functions for the convenient usage of
[VidVRD dataset](http://lms.comp.nus.edu.sg/research/VidVRD.html)
and [VidOR dataset](http://lms.comp.nus.edu.sg/research/vidor.html). 
It also contains scripts for evaluating several relevant tasks, i.e.
*video object detection*, *action detection* and *visual relation detection*.

Please note that the enclosed *baseline* does not serve as general baseline for
those tasks. You can ignore it if you are not working with the VidVRD dataset.

Please cite the following papers if the datasets help your research:
