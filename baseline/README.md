## Baseline Quick Start
1. Install the prerequisites
```
conda create -n vidvrd python=2.7 anaconda cmake tensorflow=1.8.0 keras tqdm ffmpeg=3.4 py-opencv
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 && source activate vidvrd
pip install dlib==19.3.1 --isolated
``` 

2. Download precomputed features, model and detected relations from [link](http://dl.nextcenter.org/public/imagenet-vidvrd/vidvrd-baseline-output.zip), and decompress the zipfile under the same folder as this repository.

3. Download precomputed features, model and detected relations from [here](https://zdtnag7mmr.larksuite.com/file/boxusS8Z0kwEizoPPh5h7vx7Usf), and decompress the zipfile under the same folder as this repository.

4. Run `python evaluate.py vidvrd test relation ../vidvrd-baseline-output/models/baseline_relation_prediction.json` to evaluate the precomputed detected relations. Since a few wrong labels in the dataset were corrected after paper submission, the result is slightly different from the one reported in the paper. Some qualitative results can be found [here](http://mm.zl.io).
5. Run `python baseline.py --detect` to detect video visual relations using the precomputed model.
6. Run `python baseline.py --train` to train a new model by adjusting the hyperparameters in the script, based on the precomputed features.
